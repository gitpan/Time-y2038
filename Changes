  Portability Improvements
  * Test the system time.h's limits and use them rather than the safe
    1970-2038 range.

  Test Fixes
  * Compare times using numeric equality instead of string equality to avoid
    Perl messing up on big numbers.
  * timelocal() can now take an $isdst argument to disambiguate certain
    dates which can occur twice (like daylight savings time fall back)
