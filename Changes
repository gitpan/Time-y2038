  Build Improvements
  * Moved building the program to check the limits of time.h to the code
    step to avoid having a configure_requires on ExtUtils::CBuilder.
  * Also made it quiessent and not rebuild itself unless necessary.
  * Added some sane min/max limits to the time.h limit check to avoid
    going wildly out of range and tickling system bugs that cause the
    whole thing to hang.
  * Improved the limit check so now it's a real binary search.
  * Fixed a number of off-by-one and overflow errors in the limit check.
  * Added debugging information to the limit check program.

  Doc Improvements
  * Added the location of the repository.
  * Gave a more specific location to submit bugs to.
  * Added an INSTALL file.

  Portability Improvements
  * Test the system time.h's limits and use them rather than the safe
    1970-2038 range.

  Test Fixes
  * Compare times using numeric equality instead of string equality to avoid
    Perl messing up on big numbers.
  * timelocal() can now take an $isdst argument to disambiguate certain
    dates which can occur twice (like daylight savings time fall back)
